# Python HDF5 ECF event file (Prophesee) Reader and Writer.

This implementation requires the ECF plugin from [Prophesee's HDF5 ECF GitHub repository](https://github.com/prophesee-ai/hdf5_ecf ). 
Additionally, it utilizes the meta_event_producer from either OpenEB or the Metavision SDK. 
Therefore, users need to compile OpenEB or install the Metavision SDK.

Please note that limited tests have been conducted on this implementation. Any comments or patches are welcome!
